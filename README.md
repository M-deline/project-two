## Overview
This project was designed to test our knowledge on our modules we used in class to create an application that would be useful in the real world. We chose to create an application that allows users to see a random cocktail generated. This is a fun idea for weekend plans so that people can try a new cocktail and then if they like the one generated they can save the search after logging in (or signing up).The page will also display the steps to make the drink so that users can make the drink at home if they like it. 
## Technologies Used 
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Sequelize
- CSS
- HTML
- DotEnv
- Handlebars and helpers
- Express authentication
## Challenges & Successes
This was a very challenging project since it used a lot of technologies to create a complex application. There are a lot of different files and it could be confusing to make sure we're in the correct file. For example, we couldn't get a file to save after clicking the save button and received an error button. It ended up being that the route was written incorrectly since what we were referencing had a slightly different setup. Overall, it was a success since we were able to deploy the application correctly and it functions. It was fun to create an application with these technologies since it was a big step up from the previous project. It was rewarding to see the application run as it was intended and note things that we should do next time not just for a project but in everyday coding as well. 
## Future Development
Future development would look like having more endpoints from the API where users are able to do more with the application. We could implement a share button for users if they liked a specific drink to share with their friends. There could be a featured cocktail on a Saturday or Friday so that users can try a cocktail during the weekend or we could have a section for cocktails you might like (since you liked these ones). We could also expand and have the application display information for a variety of beverages not just cocktails. We would also like to show the date (day and Month) for users so they know how close it is to weekend and for user convenience.
