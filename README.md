# Cocktail Search
Link to deployed heroku site
## Overview
This project was designed to test our knowledge on our modules we used in class to create an application that would be useful in the real world. We chose to create an application that allows users to search up a cocktail and then have the page display the name of the cocktail and the steps will appear for the user to be able to make it themselves. If the user really likes the cocktail or is interested in learning how to make mulitple, they are able to save their search to look at later so they don't have to go through the hassle of searching it all up again. If they do want to save their drink, they must create an account that is authenticated. 
## Technologies Used 
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Sequelize
- MySql
- CSS
- HTML
- DotEnv
- Handlebars and helpers
## Challenges & Successes
This was a very challenging project since it used a lot of technologies to create a complex application. There are a lot of different files and it could be confusing to make sure we're in the correct file. Overall, it was a success since we were able to deploy the application correctly and it functions.
## Future Development
Future development would look like having more endpoints from the API where users are able to do more with the application. We could implement a share button for users if they liked a specific drink to share with their friends.
